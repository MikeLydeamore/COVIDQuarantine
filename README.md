# Branching process model to simulate outbreaks in the community

This repository contains the work to take "breach events" (generated by a separate model) and seed them in the community which has a defined level of vaccine coverage (with variable efficacy).

The file `paper_pipeline.R` outlines the process to run the model.

The underlying model is written in python (see in directory `python`), and is imported into R using `reticulate`.
